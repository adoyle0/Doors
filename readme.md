# B.R.E.A.M. (Bash Rules Everything Around Me)

This is my personal desktop environment that is:

1. Reliable
1. Fast
1. Made from readily available components
1. Simple (see above)
1. Decent looking

I try to use the terminal as much as possible both for performance (I use old hardware) and so it's the same experience whether you're hands-on or remote. If it's not here then you probably don't need it

This started as a script for quick deployment of some tools when connected to a remote system and then evolved into including the rest(almost) of my environment and configs as well. Now it's how I store and sync configs between my different systems and bootstrap a fresh install

You can try it yourself if you like, on top of any Arch installation (maybe anything that uses pacman)

## Troubleshooting

### I see a black screen after logging in

Make sure your [video drivers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xorg#Driver_installation) are set up properly.

If you're confident that your drivers are set up correctly and X is not crashing then run `ka picom` in another TTY (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd>), or try to blindly open a terminal (<kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>) and run it. If everything appears to suddenly work then picom is having an issue. Try running `picom --backend xrender -b` to load picom with software rendering. If this works then you can make the changes permanent in `~/.config/picom.conf` by changing `glx` to `xrender` however these changes will be overwritten with `bream update`. If this is an issue then [let me know about it](https://git.doordesk.net/adam/bream/issues).
